Overall, both companies are focused on capacity expansion and market leadership, but Tata Steel has a more diversified approach with a focus on sustainability and venturing into new materials business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\\n| 21 | FY21-22       | Tata Steel Defined | Market Cap & Enterprise Value                                   | The analysis does not provide any specific numbers or results for the KPIs of Market Cap and Enterprise Value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The analysis does not provide any specific numbers or results for the KPI \"Market Cap & Enterprise Value.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Unfortunately, without specific numbers or results for the KPIs of Market Cap and Enterprise Value for both Tata Steels and JSW Steels, it is not possible to provide a comparative summary between their performances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\\n| 22 | FY21-22       | Tata Steel Defined | Crude steel capacity growth projection for FY 30 & beyond       | Tata Steel\\'s annual crude steel capacity in FY202122 was 34 million tonnes.

Tata Steel recorded a gross profit of ₹41,749 crore, while JSW Steel reported a lower gross profit of ₹16,702 crore. This indicates that Tata Steel was more successful in generating revenue after deducting the cost of goods sold. However, further analysis is needed to understand the factors contributing to this difference and to evaluate the overall financial performance of both companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\\n| 34 | FY21-22       | KPMG Defined       | Operating cost\\u200b                                                  | Q1 FY202122:  Total expenditure before finance cost, depreciation: ₹77,891.50 crores  Operating Profit: ₹51,129.85 crores Q2 FY202122:  Total expenditure before finance cost, depreciation: ₹91,077 crores  Operating Profit: ₹41,726 crores Q3 FY202122:  Total expenditure before finance cost, depreciation: ₹85,681.50 crores  Operating Profit: ₹43,667.50 crores Q4 FY202122:  Total expenditure before finance cost, depreciation: ₹81,009.50 crores  Operating Profit: ₹49,099.50 crores Summary:  The operating costs and profits of Tata Steel for different quarters of FY202122 are as follows:  Q1: Expenditure: ₹77,891.50 crores, Profit: ₹51,129.85 crores  Q2: Expenditure: ₹91,077 crores, Profit: ₹41,726 crores  Q3: Expenditure: ₹85,681.50 crores, Profit: ₹43,667.50 crores  Q4: Expenditure: ₹81,009.50 crores, Profit: ₹49,099.50 crores                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | There is no specific information or numbers provided in the analysis for the KPI of operating cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Based on the given data, only Tata Steel\\'s performance can be analyzed for the KPI of operating cost.
