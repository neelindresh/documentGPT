This includes investments in expanding the Kalinganagar Plant and establishing a scrap and EAF based long products plant as part of their decarbonization strategy. They are also allocating capital for transitioning to steel production using green hydrogen and blast furnace relining projects in Europe.  - JSW Steel: JSW Steel has a strong capital allocation strategy focused on capturing value-accretive opportunities while maintaining leverage below stated levels. They have ongoing capital expansion projects, including a 5mtpa brownfield expansion at Vijayanagar and a Phase-II expansion at BPSL. Their aim is to reach a total production capacity of 37 MTPA in India by FY 2024-25.   Comparing the two, both Tata Steel and JSW Steel have significant capital allocation for expansion and growth. Tata Steel's capital allocation includes investments in decarbonization and green production, while JSW Steel's focus is on expanding their existing capacities. Both companies have strategies in place to capture opportunities and maintain debt levels, but Tata Steel's capital allocation seems to have a stronger emphasis on sustainability and transitioning to greener production methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",
